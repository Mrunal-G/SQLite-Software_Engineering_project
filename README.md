This project deals with development of the ‘Autonomous Vehicle Configuration Details (AVCD) App’ which is a software solution to allow an organization to store configuration details of vehicles in XML format and transfer the data into the given relational database so that the users with different access levels can retrieve information from the database for analysis.  The project also deals with documentation of the requirements, test plans and implementations in the development of the system. 

## Program
The `vehicles_configuration_details` folder has a  `Vehicles/Assignment` folder inside it with all the code and packages.
The `vehicles_configuration_details` folder also contains the documentation report of the AVCD app titled **AVCD-App__Report.pdf**.
